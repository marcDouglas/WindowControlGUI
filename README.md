WindowControl GUI

wmctrl is a great little command that I liked to use enough to simplify it.

i've noticed a few other nice command line windows manipulation tools that I plan to fold into this.

the development is still on going and very early.  i do have a working model working using python - that I am releasing sipmly so i can learn how to use git.
